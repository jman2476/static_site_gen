# static_site_gen
Serves a static site, following boot.dev tutorial

## How to use:

Write a markdown file, then run `./build.sh` to turn your markdown file into an html document. All markdown content should be stored in the `content` directory in the same file structure as you want your finished site to have, and all static content including images and css files should be stored in the `static` directory in the same manner.
